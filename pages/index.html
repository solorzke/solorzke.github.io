                    I am a recent graduate student from New Jersey Institute of Technology who has completed his B.S.
                    in Web Applications Development - Information Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked in several projects involved in both web-applications &amp; and mobile-applications
                    ranging from
                    frameworks such as Bootstrap 4, PHP Laravel, jQuery/AJAX, and programming environments such as
                    Android Java.
                    The nature behind these projects range from building mobile-applications for social mentoring
                    programs
                    on site (school) and deploying both static and dymanic web-sites, writing server-side/shell scripts,
                    collaborating
                    with teams in a full-stack &amp; SCRUM environment to finish projects on time.

                    The purpose was to develop an application that would serve as the mobile interface of the
                    mentoring program that the program founders wanted to establish at NJIT. The application required an
                    NJIT
                    Authentication system that allowed users with a credible UCID/Password to use. Mentors are able to
                    schedule appointment/meeting check-ins throughout the semester to track the student's progress,
                    evaluate their
                    critical goals to achieve during the semester (set forth by the mentor) and deliver insightful
                    resources provided
                    by the mentor through the application's resource pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was the lead developer in the development process and designed the architecture of the
                    application.
                    Collaborating with a team of 4, I worked in managing our front-end, back-end, production and
                    deployment servers,
                    writing MySQL/PHP scripts to migrate the exchange of data, designing the front-end interface in XML,
                    and
                    class architecture through Java, using REST API to create our network requests, and setting up
                    Firebase's Messaging
                    service for our instant messaging service/notifications for our users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also ran testing of the application to identify
                    design flaws, bugs, and conduct focus groups to receive feedback about the design. Our workflow was
                    conducted under SCRUM
                    to deliver a working prototype in a short deadline before continuing to finalize the application for
                    the next year.

                    This collaborative Senior project was mine to submit at the end of the Fall 2019 semester as I was
                    on course to graduate. The goal was to first, establish a four server-cluster consisting of:
                    front-end,
                    back-end, DMZ, and a messaging broker (RabbitMq) wired into a local network router to deploy a
                    real-world
                    web-service product that identified the user's least-played video-games on their Steam backlog, and
                    present
                    Twitch/YouTube streams of those video-games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can also view their friend's least-played
                    video-games
                    and compare/contrast what their interests are in their games. Then, scale the project to 12 servers
                    culminating
                    into a 3 tier-cluster of production, development, and staging platforms before deploying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our servers were created through Virtual Box Vm's in Ubuntu 18.04 and we had to configure our static
                    IP addresses to the router. I was in charge of the front-end server, consisting of designing the
                    site's interface
                    authentication process, and writing the scripts required to produce/consume RabbitMq messages in the
                    virtual-host's queue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since our product required access to the user's Steam account including searches in Twitch/YouTube,
                    I had to parse every JSON response from its API (from RabbitMq) and use the appropriate information
                    required for use
                    in the site. The complexity of the project meant that collaborating with others was crucial, and
                    together,
                    by adopting the SCRUM workflow, we were able to build our project well and efficiently.

                </a>
                <p>
                    I was involved working with the UX/UI research team responsible for designing a prototype of an
                    Augmented Reality
                    application that assists hikers in their journey using real-time updates and peripheral equipment
                    such as Go-Pro devices.
                    I assisted in understanding what our vision is, and its motivating problem to solve: an app that
                    provides up-to-date
                    information about the trail as you hike in it. The main objective was to make a
                    mockup UI presentation (using
                    Axure RP 8) of the application that the development team would use before commencing work on it.
                    Each feature had to serve a purpose from
                    our journey maps to fulfill the goals that the app must deliver in order to satisfy the growing
                    problem that other applications aren't solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I identified our user stakeholders, before defining the typical user
                    persona that would ideally use this application in 3 main different scenarios.
                    In order to come up with that data, I conducted interviews with various subjects about their
                    thoughts towards the potential
                    existence of this app and gather their suggestions and feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwards, assist in creating our risk
                    analysis scenarios to identify potential problems occurring with a user's usage of the app and
                    conduct key-path
                    situations analyses, all with the goal of collecting as much research data as possible. The amount
                    of data collected
                    helped us create the best possible prototype we could build, which was also used in focus-group
                    testing with real hikers to gather
                    their feedback about its functionality, and most importantly, their user-experience.

                    I try to set time aside to work on smaller, personal projects that I'm able to complete because it
                    gives me the opportunity to work with other tools/resources that I haven't used yet &amp; broaden my
                    knowledge.
                    Working on this website is one of those projects because it helps me express my skills towards
                    whatever I'm
                    motivated in doing.

                    Whenever I'm AFK, I spend time at the theaters, reading/following the latest news in
                    hardware/software technology, and
                    listening to podcasts about the latest updates in web-development tools.
